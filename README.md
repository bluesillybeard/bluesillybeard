I am Bluesillybeard. My main focus is C#, but I also sometimes work with (in no order): Python, C, C++ (as much as I dislike C++)



My coding adventure started in 2013 (or was it 2015? I don't remember) when I discovered Scratch. Nowadays I dislike Scratch because it is one of the absolute worst ways you can create something. It's good for basic 2D games, but for anything more than that or learning the basics of programming, it's really challenging to get much of anything. If you genuinely use scratch for making actual games, please consider checking out a game engine (like Godot or Unity)

I also learned how to make a computer in Minecraft, and successfuly made a really basic one multiply numbers together. Since then I have been trying to make a better one, but things tend to get complicated (and laggy) really fast.

In 2017 (or was it 2018? my memory is not too great) I heard about this thing called python, so I tried to learn it on my own time. Spoiler: the official Python documentation is a REALLY BAD WAY to learn it.



it's 2019, and I get into an actual programming class. I learned HTML (which I promptly forgot the month after), Python(which I aced due to my previous attempts to learn it), and a little tiny bit Arduino. (which is basically just C with a different standard library)



During the Python unit of the class, march of 2020 happened and ruined everything. Or it would have, if the teachers kept their previous plans. It gave me a lot of time to do other stuff, as all the teachers went easy on us. Using Python, I made a basic minecraft modpack manager (Which made me realize I should just organize my mods properly), an abstract art generator (as a school project - I was supposed to make a drawing of something, but my creative mind decided to take it a bit too far), and a simplistic maze generator.



After the sumer of 2020 during my 10th grade year, I got into an intermediate (college level) Java programming class where I learned object-oriented programming, as well as several other items such as Arrays, Switch statements (well, I learned that on my own), etc.
Side note, Switch statements are one of the few things Java does better than C#



During my 10th grade year, I messed around with C# and Unity, which didn't get very far (I literally couldn't figure out movement at all). Much later in the year, I started messing with C++, and learned that it is a very old and very "ok I guess" language, full of depreciation and generally "old" stuff that few people actually like. Even the Linux kernel decided it was too good for C++, and went with C, and later added Rust code as well.

In 2021-2022 I was getting sick of Java's terrible generics and the rediculously slow nature of Intellij IDEA, so in january 2021 I decided to completely switch to using C# for any new projects.



I am familiar with:<br>
-OpenTK (OpenGL and Vulcan bindings for C#)<br>
-Fabric and Forge (Minecraft Modding Platforms)<br>
-Raylib (graphics library)<br>
-Godot (games and stuff)<br>


I prefer not to use:<br>
-Javascript (I would rather do it using C and emscripten if possible)<br>
-<br>


I use Intellij IDEA for everything in Java, and VSCode for everything else.
Codeblocks is cool for C++ and C, although I haven't quite figured it out yet.



I am a full time Linux user, because Microsoft can eat my a-- sorry, i'm trying not to rant lol. Whenever I have to use a windows computer, I am always confronted with a (in my opinion, messy) and unfamiliar GUI, and of course annoying Microsoft nonsence (It's safe to say that Cortana is not something I enjoy). Yes, I know C# is a Microsoft creation, but at least they aren't stuffing it full of ads and trackers and--- Sorry, ranting again.



As for projects I have started or completed, that list would be longer than anybody should have to read. Here is a list of a just a few:


Active:<br>
-Voxelesque, A Minecraft parody that replaces the squares with triangles. The cubes are now rectangular prisms (10% "complete", OpenTK/C#)<br>
-A game where you make a story (Raylib, C using Emscripten to make web builds)<br>
-an 8-bit microcomputer that would have released somwhere about 1985 (2%)<br>


Back-burner/on hold:<br>
-Youtube channel(s) (IHonestlyHaveNoIdea%)<br>
-A utility that renders something based on a distance value: (30% complete, its basically abandoned)<br>
-Celestial, a space game inspired by Starbound. (hardly started, Raylib. NET/C#, might use C)<br>
-an 8-bit computer built in Minecraft (60%)<br>


not started:<br>
-about 500 million.<br>
