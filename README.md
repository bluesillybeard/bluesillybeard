I am Bluesillybeard. I am a (student) Java programmer who is also somewhat familiar with Python, C#, and C++.

My coding adventure started in 2014 (or what it 2015? I don't remember) when I discovered Scratch. Nowadays I dislike Scratch because it is one of the absolute worst ways you can create something. It's good for basic 2D games, but for anything more than that or learning the basics of programming, it's really challenging to get much of anything. If you genuinely use scratch for making actual games, please consider checking out a game engine (like Godot or Unity)

In 2017 (or was it 2018? my memory is not too great) I heard about this thing called python, so I tried to learn it on my own time. Spoiler: the official Python documentation is a REALLY BAD WAY to learn it.

it's 2019, and I get into an actual programming class. I learned HTML (which I promptly forgot the month after), Python, and a little tiny bit Arduino
During the Python unit of the class, march of 2020 happened and ruined everything. As if, It gave me a lot of time to do other stuff, as all the teachers went easy on us. Using Python, I made a basic minecraft modpack manager, an abstract art generator (as a school project - I was supposed to make a drawing of something, but my creative mind decided to take it a bit too far), and a maze generator.

After the sumer of 2020 during my 10th grade year, I got into an intermediate Java programming class where I learned object-oriented programming, as well as several other items such as Arrays, Switch statements (well, I learned that on my own), etc. I have a great many projects I want to create using Java, as you'll see later.

During my 10th grade year, I messed around with C#, Unity, 

I am working with LightWeight Java Game Library (LWJGL, a 3D game library), JavaFX(A simple application API for Java), and Forge(minecraft modding platform)

I have used Unity, Pygame, TKinter, and Scratch.

I use Intellij IDEA for most projects (Though, Eclipse seems very similar to Intellij so I could probably move to that), VSCode for Python, and MonoDevelop for Unity.

I spend most of my free time watching Youtube, Playing Minecraft, or fiddling around trying to get some stupid thing to work on my Linux PC

Speaking of Linux, I am a full time Linux user. I spend all of my time on a laptop running Pop_OS 20.04, and I have an Ubuntu 20.04 PC from 2013 as backup and/or a Minecraft server. Whenever I have to use a windows computer, I am always confronted with a (in my opinion, messy) and unfamiliar GUI, and of course annoying Microsoft nonsence (It's safe to say that Cortana is not something I enjoy).

As for projects I have started or completed, that list would be longer than anybody should have to read. Here is a list of a just a few:

Programming:
Minecraft mod manager (100% completed, Python, terminal);
A utility that renders something based on a distance value supplied by a function: (30% complete, JavaFX (I'm gonna switch to LWJGL sometime soon);
Minecraft clone except instead of squares I use a tesselating regular polygon prism (not sure exactly what shape yet. Probably hexagons or triangles) (0.01%, LWJGL);
a Minecraft mod that adds a super powerful metal called YEET. It's super rare, but is extremely powerful. (30%);

other:
Youtube channel(s) (IHonestlyHaveNoIdea%);
an 8-bit microcomputer that would have released somwhere about 1985 (20 years before I was born) (1%);
The unending perpetual spontaneous reorganization of my living space (-1%);
does school count? xD;
an 8-bit computer built in Minecraft (60%);
several CPU instruction sets (I just keep coming up with new ones!);

not started:
proving my life to not be a lie;
creating a TI-89 clone;
getting crontab to shut my PC off at 23:00 so I actually stop indefinitely watching youtube videos;
A silly game about someone who needs to go to the bathroom;
getting a gaming PC (I have a PC from 2013 and a cheap laptop from 2020);
installing an ethernet plug in my room;
creating a computer in Algodoo;
custom keyboard;
a laptop made from desktop parts;
overclocking the cooling fan in my laptop;
and about 500 million more that I haven't listed.

Yes, those are semicolons.
