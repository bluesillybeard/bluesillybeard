I am Bluesillybeard. I am a (student) Java programmer who is also somewhat familiar with Python

My coding adventure started in 2014 (or what it 2015? I don't remember) when I discovered Scratch. Nowadays I dislike Scratch because it is one of the absolute worst ways you can create something

In 2017 (or was it 2018? my memory is not too great) I heard about this thing called python, so I tried to learn it on my own time. Spoiler: the official Python documentation is a REALLY BAD WAY to learn it.

it's 2019, and I get into an actual programming class. I learned HTML (which I promptly forgot the month after), Python, and a little tiny bit Arduino
During the Python unit of the class, march of 2020 happened and ruined everything. As if, It gave me a lot of time to do other stuff, as all the teachers went easy on us.

After the sumemr of 2020, I got into an intermediate Java programming class, where I learned object-oriented programming, as well as several other items such as Arrays, ArrayLists, and multidimentional Arrays.
Currently, as of febuary 2021, my Java course is close to ending, and I have many plans to use my skills in the future.

Also after the summer of 2020, I started messing around with Unity and C#. 
C# and Java are basically the same language, except one is compiled(C#), and the other has more apparant features(Java)

I am working with LightWeight Java Game Library (LWJGL, a 3D game library), JavaFX(A simple application API for Java), and Forge(minecraft modding platform)

I have used Unity, Pygame, TKinter, and Scratch.

I use Intellij IDEA for most projects (Though, Eclipse seems very similar to Intellij so I could probably move to that), VSCode for Python, and MonoDevelop for Unity.

I spend most of my free time watching Youtube, Playing Minecraft, or fiddling around trying to get some stupid thing to work on my Linux PC

Speaking of Linux, I am a full time Linux user. I spend all of my time on a Pop_OS 20.04 LTS laptop, and I have an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS PC from 2013 as backup and/or a Minecraft server.
Whenever I have to use a windows computer, I am always dissapointed by the fact that literally everything just feels slower to me, and the GUI is unfamiliar. Not to mention the

As for projects I have started or completed, that list would be longer than anybody should have to read. Here is a list of a just a few:

Programming:
Minecraft mod manager (100% completed, Python, terminal)
A utility that renders something based on a distance value supplied by a function: (10% complete, JavaFX)
Minecraft clone except instead of squares I use a tesselating regular polygon prism (not sure exactly what shape yet. Probably hexagons or triangles) (0.01%, LWJGL)
a Minecraft mod that adds a super powerful metal called YEET. It's super rare, but is extremely powerful. (30%)

other:
Youtube channel(s) (10%)
an 8-bit microcomputer that would have released somwhere about 1985 (20 years before I was born) (1%)
The unending perpetual spontaneous reorganization of my living space (-1%)
does school count? xD
an 8-bit computer built in Minecraft (60%)
several CPU instruction sets (I just keep coming up with new ones!)

not started:
proving my life to not be a lie
creating a TI-89 clone
getting crontab to shut my PC off at 23:00 so I actually stop watching youtube videos
A game about growing up (as a high-schooler, I feel a bit young to be thinking about suck philosofical questions. I am also a bit old to be so bad at spelling, lol)
A silly game about someone who needs to go to the bathroom
getting a gaming PC (I have a PC from 2013 and a cheap laptop from 2020)
installing an ethernet plug in my room
creating a computer in Algodoo
custom keyboard
a laptop made from desktop parts
