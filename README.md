Hi. I'm some guy on the internet.

Languages I know well are:
- C#
- Java
- GDScript

Languages I can use (but aren't particularily good at) are:
- C (My favorite low-level language, although I need more practice with it)
- Python (as much as I hate it)
- PHP (it's an old gross one, but it works really well)
- 6502 Assembly (with great headache)
- Zig (although it's still in early days so things keep chaning and documentation is limited)

Languages I despise are:
- Python (no real type safety, annoying importance of whitespace, extreme performance issues)
- Bash (is this even a real language?)
- Shell Script (Not as bad as Bash though)

Languages I want to learn / get better at are:
- C
- Rust (it's a neat language, although it's quite complex)
- Assembly (to achieve ultimate chad status)
- Lua (extremely popular scripting language)
- APL (so I can obliterate my brain)

Frameworks I know well are:
- VRender (I'm the guy who built it so yeah)
- BasicGUI (Again, I know this well because I created it myself)
- Scratch (I used it when I was 12 years old and never really forgot)
- OpenTK
- LWJGL
- OpenGL
- Raylib (my favorite library of all time)
- Godot (with displeasure, although it works great for quick mini-projects and prototypes)

Frameworks I can use are:
- Minecraft modding (Fabric, Forge, and Quilt)
- MonoGame
- Unity (I don't really like it though)
- Processing (it's basically just a Java library with a weird IDE to go with it)
- HTML+CSS+JS (although I need more practice before I can make much more than a beginners app)
