I am Bluesillybeard. I am a (student) Java programmer who is also somewhat familiar with Python, C#, and C++.



My coding adventure started in 2013 (or was it 2015? I don't remember) when I discovered Scratch. Nowadays I dislike Scratch because it is one of the absolute worst ways you can create something. It's good for basic 2D games, but for anything more than that or learning the basics of programming, it's really challenging to get much of anything. If you genuinely use scratch for making actual games, please consider checking out a game engine (like Godot or Unity)



In 2017 (or was it 2018? my memory is not too great) I heard about this thing called python, so I tried to learn it on my own time. Spoiler: the official Python documentation is a REALLY BAD WAY to learn it.



it's 2019, and I get into an actual programming class. I learned HTML (which I promptly forgot the month after), Python(which I aced due to my previous attempts to learn it), and a little tiny bit Arduino.



During the Python unit of the class, march of 2020 happened and ruined everything. Just Kidding! It gave me a lot of time to do other stuff, as all the teachers went easy on us. Using Python, I made a basic minecraft modpack manager (Which made me realize I should just organize my mods properly), an abstract art generator (as a school project - I was supposed to make a drawing of something, but my creative mind decided to take it a bit too far), and a simplistic maze generator.



After the sumer of 2020 during my 10th grade year, I got into an intermediate (college level) Java programming class where I learned object-oriented programming, as well as several other items such as Arrays, Switch statements (well, I learned that on my own), etc. I have a great many projects I want to create using Java, as you'll see later.



During my 10th grade year, I messed around with C# and Unity, which didn't get very far (I literally couldn't figure out movement at all). Much later in the year, I started messing with C++, and learned that it is a very matured language. I would probably prefer it to Java, but VSCode isn't smart enough to update CMakeLists, so literally every single new file I add I have to add it to that. (that's actually why I perfer Java).



I am working with:
-LightWeight Java Game Library (LWJGL)
-OpenGL(the LWJGL Binding)
-JavaFX and Swing(They aren't preffereable though)
-Fabric and Forge (Minecraft Modding Platforms)



I use Intellij IDEA for basically everything Java, VSCode for smaller Python projects



I am a full time Linux user. I spend all of my time on a laptop running Pop_OS 20.04, and I have a PC from 2013 running Ubuntu 20.04 as backup and/or a Minecraft server. Whenever I have to use a windows computer, I am always confronted with a (in my opinion, messy) and unfamiliar GUI, and of course annoying Microsoft nonsence (It's safe to say that Cortana is not something I enjoy).



As for projects I have started or completed, that list would be longer than anybody should have to read. Here is a list of a just a few:



Programming:

-Minecraft mod manager (100% completed, Python terminal)

-A utility that renders something based on a distance value: (30% complete, JavaFX (I'm gonna switch to LWJGL sometime soon)

-Voxelesque, A Minecraft parody that replaces the squares with triangles. The cubes are now rectangular prisms (10% "complete", Java, LWJGL/OpenGL)



other:

-Youtube channel(s) (IHonestlyHaveNoIdea%)

-an 8-bit microcomputer that would have released somwhere about 1985 (20 years before I was born) (2%)

-an 8-bit computer built in Minecraft (60%)



not started:

-A silly game about someone who needs to go to the bathroom;

-Celestial, a space game inspired by Starbound.

-installing an ethernet plug in my room;

-and about 500 million more that I haven't listed.
